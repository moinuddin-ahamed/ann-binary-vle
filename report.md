### Executive Summary

This project implements a production-quality artificial neural network (ANN) to predict vapor composition (y₁) in binary azeotropic systems. The model was developed for the Ethanol-Water system using TensorFlow/Keras and achieved exceptional performance with an R² score of 0.9828 on test data, significantly outperforming the Raoult's Law baseline (R² = 0.3156).

### 1. Methodology

#### 1.1 Dataset Generation
